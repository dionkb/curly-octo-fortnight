  ## Description

  This command-line application is used to allow a user to generate a simple SVG graphic logo. The user runs the application by typing "node index.js" in the command line, and is then prompted to answer a series of questions. The answers are run through various methods of validation and functions to generate a simple logo based on the user inputs.
